# fbb-mcp

Fantasy Baseball MCP Server for Claude. Manage your Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league through natural conversation — ask Claude to optimize your lineup, analyze trades, scout opponents, find waiver pickups, and make roster moves, all backed by real-time data and rendered in rich inline UIs.

**Built with:** [yahoo_fantasy_api](https://github.com/uberfastman/yahoo_fantasy_api) | [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) | [MLB-StatsAPI](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI) | [MCP Apps (ext-apps)](https://github.com/anthropics/model-context-protocol/tree/main/packages/ext-apps) | [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) | [MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)

## What It Does

This MCP server gives Claude direct access to your Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league, real-time MLB data, and advanced analytics. Instead of switching between Yahoo's app, Baseball Savant, Reddit, and spreadsheets, you just talk to Claude.

**Ask things like:**
- "Who should I pick up this week to help my batting average?"
- "Is it worth trading Soto for two mid-tier pitchers?"
- "Set my lineup for today — bench anyone without a game"
- "Who are the best streaming pitchers for next week?"
- "What's the buzz on Reddit about [player]?"

### How It Works

Claude calls the MCP tools to pull live data, run analysis, and take action on your behalf. Behind the scenes:

1. **Yahoo Fantasy API** — Your roster, standings, matchups, free agents, transactions, and league settings come from Yahoo's OAuth API in real time. Every tool call fetches current data, not cached snapshots.

2. **Analytics engine** — Z-score valuations tuned to your league's stat categories, powered by Steamer projections auto-fetched from FanGraphs (with in-season blending of projections + live stats weighted by games played). Category gap analysis to find your weaknesses, H2H matchup strategy (target/protect/concede/lock), trade evaluation with positional scarcity, and a trade finder that scans every team for complementary deals.

3. **Player intelligence** — Every player surface is enriched with Statcast data (xwOBA, exit velocity, barrel rate, percentile rankings, pitch arsenal), recent trend splits (7/14/30 day), plate discipline metrics (FanGraphs), Reddit sentiment from r/fantasybaseball, and MLB transaction alerts. Before the season starts, Savant data automatically falls back to the prior year so intel surfaces stay populated during spring training.

4. **Browser automation** — Write operations (add, drop, trade, lineup changes) use Playwright to automate the Yahoo Fantasy website directly, since Yahoo's API no longer grants write scope to new developer apps. Read operations still use the fast OAuth API.

5. **Inline UI apps** — Tool results aren't just text. Eight Preact + Tailwind HTML apps with 62 views render interactive tables, charts, and dashboards directly inside Claude's response using MCP Apps (`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`).

### Data Flow

When you ask Claude a question, here's what happens:

```
You: "Should I drop Player X for Player Y?"

Claude calls:
  1. yahoo_roster          → your current roster + intel overlays
  2. yahoo_category_check  → your weak/strong categories
  3. yahoo_value (X)       → Player X z-score breakdown
  4. yahoo_value (Y)       → Player Y z-score breakdown
  5. yahoo_category_simulate → projected category rank changes

Claude synthesizes all 5 results and gives you a recommendation
with specific category-level reasoning.
```

Claude decides which tools to call and in what order based on your question. Complex questions may chain 3-8 tool calls. Simple lookups ("show my roster") are a single call.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Yahoo API credentials

Go to [developer.yahoo.com/apps/create](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create), create an app with **Fantasy Sports** read permissions and `oob` as the redirect URI. Copy the consumer key and secret.

### 2. Configure and run

```bash
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set YAHOO_CONSUMER_KEY and YAHOO_CONSUMER_SECRET
mkdir -p config data
docker compose up -d
```

The container auto-generates `config/yahoo_oauth.json` from your env vars on first start. You don't need to create this file manually.

### 3. Find your league and team IDs

On the first API call, Yahoo will prompt you to authorize the app. Run `discover` to trigger auth and find your IDs in one step:

```bash
./yf discover
```

Follow the prompt — open the URL, log in, paste the verification code. The command then prints your current-season leagues and teams:

```
Your 469 MLB Fantasy Leagues:

  1. My League Name
     Season: 2026  |  Teams: 12
     LEAGUE_ID=469.l.12345
     TEAM_ID=469.l.12345.t.7  (My Team Name)

Add these to your .env file:

  LEAGUE_ID=469.l.12345
  TEAM_ID=469.l.12345.t.7
```

Copy the values into `.env`, then restart:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Tokens refresh automatically after the initial authorization.

### 4. Connect to Claude

Add to your `.mcp.json` (Claude Code) or `claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fbb-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "fbb-mcp", "node", "/app/mcp-apps/dist/main.js", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Everything runs inside Docker — no local dependencies beyond Docker itself.

### 5. Enable write operations (optional)

To let Claude make roster moves (add, drop, trade, set lineup), set `ENABLE_WRITE_OPS=true` in `.env`, rebuild with `docker compose up -d`, and set up a browser session:

```bash
./yf browser-login
```

This opens a browser — log into Yahoo manually. The session saves to `config/yahoo_session.json` and lasts 2-4 weeks.

### 6. Enable preview dashboard (optional)

To browse all 62 UI views in your browser, set `ENABLE_PREVIEW=true` in `.env` and rebuild:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open `http://localhost:4951/preview` (or your `MCP_SERVER_URL/preview`). The preview app lets you switch between mock and live data, toggle dark/light mode, and explore every view the MCP server can render.

## Connecting to Claude

The MCP server supports two transports: **stdio** (local, for Claude Code and Claude Desktop) and **Streamable HTTP** (remote, for Claude.ai). Both use the same tools and backend.

**Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — Add the config from [Quick Start step 4](#4-connect-to-claude) to `.mcp.json` (Claude Code) or `claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop). Config file paths for Claude Desktop:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Restart the app after saving.

### Claude.ai (remote access)

Claude.ai can't run local processes, so the MCP server needs to be reachable over the internet. You need a machine running Docker, a domain name, and a reverse proxy for HTTPS.

**1. Set env vars** in `.env`:

```bash
MCP_SERVER_URL=https://your-domain.com
MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

`MCP_SERVER_URL` must match exactly what Claude.ai connects to — it's used to generate OAuth callback URLs.

**2. Set up a reverse proxy** to forward HTTPS to the container's port 4951:

<details>
<summary>Caddy (automatic HTTPS)</summary>

```
your-domain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:4951
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>nginx</summary>

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4951;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
</details>

Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale Funnel, and Pangolin also work.

**3. Rebuild and connect:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

In Claude.ai, go to Settings > Integrations > Add MCP Server, enter `https://your-domain.com/mcp`. You'll be redirected to a login page — enter your `MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD` to authorize. The token persists across sessions.

<details>
<summary>How the auth flow works</summary>

The MCP server implements MCP OAuth 2.1 using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. No third-party auth provider needed — the password is checked directly against `MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD`.

```
Claude.ai → GET /mcp → 401 Unauthorized
         → discovers OAuth metadata at /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
         → redirects user to /authorize → /login (password form)
         → user enters password → /login/callback validates it
         → issues authorization code → Claude.ai exchanges for bearer token
         → GET/POST /mcp with Authorization: Bearer <token> → tools work
```
